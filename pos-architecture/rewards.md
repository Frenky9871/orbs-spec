# Year Zero Rewards
The Orbs Universe applies an economic incentive layer to encourage its members to participate and maintain the network live and secure. Orbs Universe rewards are calculated per election term, proportionally to the election term duration (approximately 3 days), and are distributed every 3 months.

## Participation Reward (Delegators and Guardians)
Token holders that delegate their voting weight to an active Guardian - a Guardian that cast a vote that is valid for the election, are awarded proportionally to the their stake. Delegators and Guardians are awarded up to 60M ORBS annual reward divided proportionally to their stake. In case the reward for one term exceeds an 8% annual rate, the reward for that term is set to an annual rate of 8%.

## Guardians Excellence Reward Program
Guardians are rewarded for their own stake as part of the participation reward. In addition, in order to encourage Guardian activities and community building, leading Guardians are rewarded with the Guardians Excellence Program.

In each election term, the leading 10 Guardians that actively participated in the elections and had the highest total delegated stake (stake delegated to them including their own stake) are awarded. The leading 10 Guardians are awarded up to 40M ORBS annual reward divided proportionally to their total delegated stake.  In case the reward for one term exceeds a 10% annual rate, the reward for that term is set to an annual rate of 10%.

## Operation Reward (Validators)
Elected Validators are rewarded 4% annual rate of the Validator own stake for the duration the Validator was elected. In addition, in the networkâ€™s early stakes, each elected Validator is awarded with an additional 1M annual reward proportionally to the duration the Validator was elected.

In addition to the operation reward, like any other token holder a Validator may delegate her own stake to a Guardian and receive the participation reward. 

### Virtual Chain Subscription Fees
In addition to the operation reward, Validators receive the operation fees paid by applications. The fees are paid on a monthly basis to the subscription smart contract and are divided among the Validators. For more information see [Orbs Operation Fees](https://www.orbs.com/pricing).
