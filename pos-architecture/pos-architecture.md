# Orbs PoS Architecture
> Describes Orbs PoS architecture in its V1 version.

> Discusses the different roles, the election process in which Guardians and Validators are elected and the rewards awarded to the different roles. 

> The architecture is likely to be adjusted over time in order to strengthen the long term viability of the network. The primary source of these changes will come from the direct interaction with the initial ecosystem participants to collaborate on the ideal path forward.

## Roles in Orbs Universe
The Orbs Universe is centered around three core roles - Validators, Guardians and Delegators.

**Validators** - Validators operate the Orbs network. They align with the network interests by ensuring honest operation and maintaining security and availability. Based on the Validators own stake.

**Guardians** - Guardians maintain the security of the network and uphold its long term vision. They have wide representation of the ecosystem, by delegated stake and can vote out Validators that do not follow the protocol.

**Delegators** - Delegators are token holders who assign responsibility for their voting weight (stake) to Guardians, empowering them to align the network with the best interests of the ecosystem.
